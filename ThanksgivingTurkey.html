        <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed </li>
        <li>2 cups kosher salt </li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter, melted </li>

        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf </li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine </li>
    <ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Rub the turkey inside and out with the kosher salt. Place the bird in a large stock pot, and cover with cold water. Place in the refrigerator, and allow the turkey to soak in the salt and water mixture 12 hours, or overnight.
        </li>

        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly rinse the turkey, and discard the brine mixture.
        </li>

        <li>Brush the turkey with 1/2 the melted butter. Place breast side down on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Stuff the turkey cavity with 1 onion, 1/2 the carrots, 1/2 the celery, 1 sprig of thyme, and the bay leaf. Scatter the remaining vegetables and thyme around the bottom of the roasting pan, and cover with the white wine.
        </li>

        <li>Roast uncovered 3 1/2 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until the internal temperature of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F (85 degrees C). Carefully turn the turkey breast side up about 2/3 through the roasting time, and brush with the remaining butter. Allow the bird to stand about 30 minutes before carving.
        </li>
