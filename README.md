# odin-recepies
I am currently following the Odin Project Foundations course corriculum and this is my first project for finishing the basic html part

I will be making a recepie site where i will put random recepies

This will be started 24 Nov 2021 and i will be using HTML 5 as of writing this


it has been 2 days, i finally finished and i must say i am very happy about how it turned out.

in the end it took me like 4 hours because of school and similar stuff it took me this long but i dont regret it in the least
